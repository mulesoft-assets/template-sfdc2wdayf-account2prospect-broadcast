As a Salesforce admin I want to synchronize Accounts and Prospects between Salesforce and Workday.

This Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online synchronization of Accounts from SalesForce instance to Prospects in Workday instance. Every time there is a new Account or a change in an already existing one with type=Prospect, the integration will poll for changes in SalesForce source instance and it will be responsible for updating the Prospect in the target Workday instance.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing)
The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.
The integration is triggered by a poll defined in the flow that is going to trigger the application, querying newest SalesForce updates/creations matching a filter criteria and executing the batch job.
During the Process stage, each Salesforce Account will be checked, if it has an existing matching Prospect in the Workday instance.
The last step of the Process stage will group the Accounts and insert/update them in Workday.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Template will log output statistics data into the console.

<![CDATA[
To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source (Salesforce) and destination (Workday) systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. 
**Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

This particular Anypoint Template illustrate the broadcast use case between Salesforce and a Workday, thus it requires a Workday instance to work.

While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**. 
Follow other steps defined [here](#runonpremise) and once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. Every time a Account is created or modified, it will be automatically synchronised to supplied Workday instance.

Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. However, we make API call to Salesforce only once during migration, so this is not something to worry about.

Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow that will poll for Salesforce creations/updates. The severeal message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Template:

1. During the Input stage the Template will go to the Salesforce and query all the existing Accounts that match the filter criteria.
2. During the Process stage, each Salesforce Account ID will be checked in external ID field in Workday (Prospect\_Reference\_ID), if it has an existing matching objects in Workday.
3. Then upsert of the relevant Prospect fields is performed in Workday
4. Finally during the On Complete stage the Template will logoutput statistics data into the console.
